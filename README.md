## Overview

The **Advanced Multi-Service Username Validator** is a tool designed to check the availability of usernames across multiple services. It’s built to be extensible, allowing you to add your own checkers, similar to tools like Silver or Open Bullet.

## How to Use

1. **Add Usernames**:
   - Place the usernames you want to check in the `usernames.txt` file.

2. **Understand Threads**:
   - Each thread checks one username across all services simultaneously.
   - Example: Using 3 threads means 3 usernames are checked at once, with a progress bar for each.

3. **Extensibility**:
   - The tool is designed for customization. You can add your own checkers, as all follow the same format.

4. **Rate Limits**:
   - Services like **GitHub** and **Roblox** may impose rate limits, so use threads wisely to avoid restrictions.
